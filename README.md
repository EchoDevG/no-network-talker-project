# no-network-talker-project


The non network prototype to my networking project, so it works while I finish the network prototype.

It has kinda became the actual product, until I get a couple days with a second windows computer with VS installed, cause I'm not even attempting it with monodevelop on linux, I doubt it would work anyway. So yeah, updates are on here, its a more polished thing anyway :))

Any bugs (theres bound to be hundreds) just restart the program. Email me if you have my email address. I'm not going out of my way to fix bugs you guys find cause why would I? Its only intended for one persons use, I'm only sharing it to people who would find it a cool thing to look at for a couple of minutes. This policy will change when I distribute it to anyone who needs it, but for now it is literally solely for my dad, and therefore bugs he find will have top priority. Enjoy it all the same!
